## PART 7: RISK MITIGATION

### Top 4 Identified Risks

**Risk 1: Tier-1 Speaker Declines / Limited Confirmations**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (40% risk of <4 Tier-1 confirmations)
- **Impact:** MODERATE (delays confirmation, requires Tier-2 activation)
- **Mitigation:**
  1. Parallel Tier-2 outreach (Dec 1 if needed)
  2. Personal phone calls to warm prospects (not just email)
  3. Leverage Rijenn's endorsement ("personally recommended by IPS organizers")
  4. Emphasize panel prestige and media coverage value

**Risk 2: Speaker Last-Minute Cancellations (Jan-Mar 2026)**
- **Probability:** LOW (10% per speaker)
- **Impact:** MODERATE (requires replacement speaker, reduced panel quality)
- **Mitigation:**
  1. Maintain 2-3 backup speakers from Tier-2 (briefed but not confirmed)
  2. Schedule prep calls 4 weeks before event (hold commitment)
  3. Confirm speakers 2 weeks before event (final check-in)
  4. Have backup questions prepared for any speaker absence

**Risk 3: Poor Panel Execution / Low Quality Moderation**
- **Probability:** LOW (10% risk - Alexander has PTC25 London success)
- **Impact:** HIGH (damages event experience, IPS reputation)
- **Mitigation:**
  1. Comprehensive prep work (90%+ goal)
  2. Detailed panelist profiles and prepared questions
  3. Backup questions for off-track discussions
  4. Time management coaching (40 minutes, keep tight)
  5. Run-of-show with DLD team (confirm timing, transitions)

**Risk 4: Low Event Attendance / Diminished Platform Value**
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (40% risk of lower-than-expected attendance)
- **Impact:** MODERATE (reduces networking ROI, media value)
- **Mitigation:**
  1. Assume 40,000 visitors is target, but plan for 30-35K actual
  2. Focus on quality over quantity (institutional audience = high-value)
  3. Target influential media and decision-makers (not just volume)
  4. DocumentPropertyTalents pipeline leads regardless of total attendance
