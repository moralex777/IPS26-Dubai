# RWA Oracle Compliance Startup
## IPS26 Pitch Positioning & Narrative Framework

**Created:** November 10, 2025
**Event:** IPS Congress 2026 (PropTech Startups Pillar)
**Dates:** April 13-15, 2026
**Pitch Duration:** ~10 minutes (competition format TBD by Rijenn)

---

## ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)

> "We're building the world's first **globally-regulated AI-enhanced oracle for tokenized real estate**. Institutional capital ($100+ trillion in AUM) wants to invest in real estate tokens, but needs compliant data feeds. We've solved the regulatory puzzle across Singapore, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, and the UAE in 6 months - what takes competitors 24 months. Our first institutional pilots are live."

---

## 2-MINUTE PITCH (Competition Format)

### Opening: Problem Statement (30 seconds)

"Institutional investors—sovereign wealth funds, pensions, family offices—represent $100+ trillion in global AUM. They're ready to tokenize real estate. But one problem blocks them: **compliance**.

Existing oracles like Chainlink are unregulated. Banks can't use them. Regulators demand licensed data providers. The compliance barrier alone costs 18-24 months and millions in legal costs.

This is why tokenized real estate adoption is stuck."

### Solution (30 seconds)

"We've solved this. We built the **first globally-regulated oracle for tokenized real estate**—with MiCA compliance baked in, plus Singapore MAS, Hong Kong SFC, and Luxembourg CSSF frameworks.

Our unfair advantage? **Tomasz Janyst**. He already has 10+ licenses across 7 jurisdictions. In 6 months, what takes competitors 24 months. That's an **18-24 month regulatory moat**."

### Traction (30 seconds)

"We're shipping with 3 institutional pilots:

1. **Institutional real estate tokenization platform** - deploying data feed in Q2 2026
2. **Sovereign wealth fund** - evaluating RWA oracle for fund portfolio
3. **Digital banking consortium** - testing compliance bridge for tokenized deposits

This isn't theoretical. Institutional customers are asking for this solution today."

### Ask (15 seconds)

"We're raising our seed round to accelerate regulatory approvals and hire technical team. We're looking for investors who understand **infrastructure plays in institutional finance**—the companies that enable $100+ trillion markets."

## PITCH NARRATIVE THEMES (Key Messages)

### Theme 1: "Institutional-Grade Infrastructure" (NOT Crypto Hype)

**Why This Matters:**
- IPS26 audience = institutional investors (not retail speculators)
- Differentiate from "DeFi oracle" companies
- Emphasize regulatory credibility (Tomasz 10+ licenses)

**Messaging:**
- "This is for sovereign wealth funds, pensions, family offices"
- "Regulatory compliance is our unfair advantage, not afterthought"
- "We're building institutional infrastructure, not consumer products"

### Theme 2: "18-24 Month Window" (Urgency + Competitive Advantage)

**Why This Matters:**
- Creates scarcity narrative (first-mover advantage expires)
- Motivates investor conviction ("act now or miss moat")
- Explains why seed capital is urgent (time-sensitive licensing window)

**Messaging:**
- "Competitors need 18-24 months to replicate our regulatory moat"
- "We're 6 months ahead on Singapore MAS licensing alone"
- "This window closes when Chainlink announces regulated oracle division"

### Theme 3: "Infrastructure Play" (Not Application)

**Why This Matters:**
- Infrastructure plays have higher unit economics (better margins)
- Institutional investors prefer infrastructure (enables multiple applications)
- Positions as "enabling platform" (not direct real estate competition)

**Messaging:**
- "We're building the rails, not the trains"
- "Our oracle enables real estate tokenization, banking, fund management"
- "Single product serves 3+ use cases with high ARPU"

### Theme 4: "Operator-Investor Founder Team"

**Why This Matters:**
- Alexander = Pre-A Club VC GP (investor credibility)
- Tomasz = Compliance expert (technical credibility)
- Not "struggling founders" but "infrastructure builders"

**Messaging:**
- "I invest in what I build - skin in the game"
- "We have Tomasz's regulatory expertise baked into company DNA"
- "Pre-A Club VC will be customer #4 (eating our own dog food)"

## COMPETITIVE MESSAGING

### Against Chainlink (Unregulated Oracle)

**Our Advantage:** Regulatory compliance (18-24 month moat)

**Messaging:**
- "Chainlink is great for DeFi. For institutional capital, compliance is required."
- "We're not competing with Chainlink. We're solving what Chainlink can't: regulated data feeds."

**Vulnerability to Address:** Chainlink's market cap ($19B) vs. our startup status

**Counter:** "They're catching on too. But they'll need 18-24 months to build what Tomasz already has."

### Against RedStone, Pyth (Alternative Oracles)

**Our Advantage:** RWA specialization + regulatory focus (not general-purpose oracles)

**Messaging:**
- "They're building general-purpose oracles. We're building institutional real estate infrastructure."
- "Their focus is DeFi traders. Our focus is sovereign wealth, pensions, family offices."

### Against Traditional Data Providers (Bloomberg, Refinitiv)

**Our Advantage:** Blockchain-native + AI-enhanced

**Messaging:**
- "Traditional data providers move slow. We're built for speed and blockchain integration."
- "AI-powered compliance validation embedded in architecture (they require manual review)."

---

## RISK ACKNOWLEDGMENT & MITIGATION (Investor Questions)

### Q1: "You're pre-revenue. Why should we believe this?"

**Answer:**
"We have 3 institutional pilots deploying Q2-Q3 2026. These aren't letters of intent—these are active discussions with live product integration timelines. We're showing $100K+ ARPUs in pre-revenue phase, which institutional investors validate."

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Pilot customer names (anonymized if needed)
- SOW timelines (Q2-Q3 2026 deployment)
- ARPU projections ($100K-500K institutional standard)

### Q2: "Regulatory approval takes 18-24 months. How are you doing it in 6?"

**Answer:**
"Tomasz already has 10+ licenses across 7 jurisdictions. We're not starting from zero. Singapore MAS approval is already in advanced discussions based on his track record. This isn't theoretical—he's been through this process at ICBC and Ant International."

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Tomasz's license portfolio
- Existing relationships with FCA, CSSF, DNB, DFSA, SAMA
- MAS pre-approval conversations (if appropriate to share)

### Q3: "What if Chainlink copies you in 18 months?"

**Answer:**
"Two things: First, we'll already have $2-5M ARR and institutional market dominance by then. Second, our moat isn't just regulatory—it's customer relationships. Institutional allocators don't switch data providers lightly. Once we're embedded in their processes, switching costs are high."

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Institutional customer stickiness (high ARPU = long-term relationship value)
- Regulatory moat compounds (each jurisdiction approval makes next one easier)

### Q4: "Why Pre-A Club VC GP + Tomasz? Unusual founder combo."

**Answer:**
"This is intentional. I invest in what I understand—tokenization infrastructure. Tomasz solves the compliance technical problem. Together, we're operator-investor team that understands both institutional capital and regulatory risk. This combination is rare and valuable."

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Marc Andreessen (Netscape founder → a16z GP)
- Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn → Greylock)
- Peter Thiel (PayPal → Founders Fund)

## PITCH DELIVERY TIPS

### 1. Lead with Problem (Not Solution Hype)

**Good Opening:**
"$100+ trillion in institutional capital wants to invest in tokenized real estate. But they can't—because compliance frameworks don't exist. When I started researching this problem, every institutional investor said the same thing: 'Great idea, but we need licensed data providers.' That's the problem we're solving."

**Avoid:**
"We're building a blockchain oracle using AI and machine learning..."

### 2. Make Tomasz the Hero (Not Alexander)

**Good Framing:**
"Our unfair advantage is Tomasz Janyst. He has 10 licenses across 7 jurisdictions. His regulatory expertise IS our product."

**Avoid:**
"Alexander and Tomasz are both very experienced..."

### 3. Use Proof Over Promises

**Good Evidence:**
- "3 institutional pilots deploying Q2-Q3 2026 (specific timelines)"
- "Singapore MAS licensing process already advanced (specific regulator)"
- "Tomasz already has 10 licenses (documented proof)"

**Avoid:**
- "We believe institutional investors will adopt..."
- "We're excited about the opportunity..."

### 4. Institutional Tone (Not Startup Hype)

**Good Tone:**
- Measured, confident, credible
- Regulatory expertise focus
- Institutional customer language
- Long-term positioning

**Avoid:**
- "Disrupting the oracle market..."
- "Building the future of real estate..."
- Crypto jargon (blockchain, DeFi, crypto)
