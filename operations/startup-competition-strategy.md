## PART 1: STARTUP CONCEPT (RWA COMPLIANCE ORACLE)

### Problem Statement

Institutional investors ($100+ trillion in AUM) **cannot safely access tokenized real estate / RWA markets** due to:

1. **Data Unreliability:** No regulated oracles for off-chain asset data
2. **Compliance Uncertainty:** Existing oracles (Chainlink, Pyth, RedStone) unregulated
3. **Trust Gap:** Banks/institutions require licensed data providers
4. **Geographic Fragmentation:** Regulations differ per jurisdiction

### Solution

**World's First Globally-Regulated AI-Enhanced RWA Oracle**

- Real-World Asset data oracle with **embedded regulatory compliance**
- Built-in MiCA (EU), Singapore MAS, Hong Kong SFC, Luxembourg CSSF frameworks
- 5-20x cheaper than Chainlink, institutional-grade licensing
- RWA specialization (not general-purpose oracle)
- First-mover advantage: 18-24 month regulatory moat before competitors

### Target Customers

**Tier 1 - Institutional Investors (Perfect IPS26 Audience Match):**
- Sovereign wealth funds
- Pension funds
- Family offices
- Insurance companies

**Tier 2 - Tokenization Platforms:**
- Real estate tokenization platforms (RealT, Lofty, Tangible)
- Security token exchanges (tZERO, Securitize)
- Institutional DeFi protocols (Maple Finance, Centrifuge)

**Tier 3 - Traditional Finance:**
- Banks experimenting with tokenized deposits
- Asset managers creating tokenized funds
- Custodians requiring compliance infrastructure

### Competitive Edge

1. **Regulatory Moat:** First globally-regulated oracle (18-24 month head start)
2. **Cost Advantage:** 5-20x cheaper than Chainlink
3. **AI-Enhanced Validation:** Automated compliance embedded in architecture
4. **RWA Specialization:** Not general-purpose, but RWA-focused

### Revenue Model (Institutional-Grade ARPU)

- **Freemium approach:** Open-source foundation
- **Enterprise ARPU:** $100K-500K/year (vs. DeFi protocols $5K-50K)
- **Unit Economics:** LTV/CAC 50-100:1, Gross Margin 75-80%

### Financial Projections

| Timeframe | Revenue | Milestone |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Year 1 | $500K-800K | Bootstrapped, 3 institutional pilots |
| Year 3 | $5M-10M | Profitable, Series A fundraising |
| Year 5 | Exit potential | $50M-200M valuation |

## PART 4: CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Go/No-Go Decision Points

**DECISION 1: By Nov 30, 2025**
- ✅ GO if: Tomasz confirmed + competition details favorable + timeline compatible
- ❌ NO-GO if: Tomasz unavailable OR competition closed OR timeline impossible

**DECISION 2: By Dec 15, 2025**
- ✅ GO if: MAS application drafted + CTO recruitment active + pitch deck v1 complete
- ❌ NO-GO if: 2+ milestones missed (abort due to execution risk)

**DECISION 3: By Jan 31, 2026**
- ✅ GO if: CTO hired + MVP in development + 3 pilots identified
- ❌ NO-GO if: CTO recruitment stalled (no senior technical talent available)

**DECISION 4: By Feb 28, 2026**
- ✅ GO if: 3 pilot agreements signed + demo working
- ❌ NO-GO if: Zero customer validation (vaporware risk, pivot to pre-revenue pitch)

### Abort Scenarios

**Abort Immediately If:**
1. Tomasz Janyst declines co-founder role (no regulatory moat = 4/10 viability)
2. Singapore MAS research reveals blockers (licensing pathway impossible)
3. CTO recruitment stalled beyond Jan 31 (no technical execution capability)

**Pivot to Pre-Revenue Pitch If:**
- Pilots not signed by Feb 28 (transition to "licensed-in-process" narrative)
- Emphasize regulatory expertise (Tomasz 10+ licenses), not customer traction

## PART 5: IPS26 STRATEGIC POSITIONING

### Positioning Statement (NOT "Struggling Founder")

> "I'm a Pre-A Club VC GP who builds portfolio infrastructure companies. At IPS26, I'm showcasing our RWA compliance oracle (Tomasz Janyst partnership) that enables tokenized real estate for institutional investors. I'm also moderating panels on institutional real estate + capital allocation."

### Key Message Architecture

**Message 1: Operator + Investor Credibility**
- "I invest in what I understand deeply - tokenization compliance IS my expertise"
- Pattern: Marc Andreessen (Netscape), Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn), Peter Thiel (PayPal)
- Most credible VC archetype = founder-investor hybrid

**Message 2: Portfolio Infrastructure Value**
- "I'm building the compliance rails my portfolio companies need"
- Differentiator: Not competitor to portfolio, but infrastructure enabler
- Strategic moat: Invested LPs want ecosystem value

**Message 3: Institutional-Grade Solution (Not Crypto Hype)**
- "This is for sovereign wealth, pensions, family offices - not DeFi speculators"
- Regulatory credibility (Tomasz 10+ licenses)
- Institutional customer focus (not retail)

### Multi-Role Credibility at IPS26

| Role | Positioning | Value |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Panel Moderator** (IPS Conference) | PropertyTalents CEO moderating institutional real estate trends | Leadership perspective |
| **Boardroom Moderator** (Institutional Investor Summit) | Pre-A Club VC GP leading capital allocation discussions | Investor perspective |
| **Startup Competition** | Founder of compliance infrastructure play | Operator perspective |

**Total Positioning:** Investor + Operator + Leader = most credible profile at institutional conference

---

## PART 6: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING AT IPS26

### Why This Startup Fits IPS26 Perfectly

**Audience Match:**
- 40,000+ institutional real estate professionals attending
- Sovereign wealth, pensions, family offices = exact customer profile
- Institutional capital ($100+ trillion) exploring tokenization = target buyer pool

**Timing Match:**
- BlackRock tokenized $2B+ (institutional validation signal)
- MiCA implementation 2024-2025 (EU regulatory clarity)
- Singapore/Hong Kong frameworks finalized (Asian expansion)
- Dubai VARA crypto regulations established (regional credibility)

**Narrative Match:**
- IPS26 = "institutional capital meets innovation"
- Startup = bridges institutional capital to tokenized real estate
- Tomasz = global regulatory expertise (Singapore, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, UAE, UK)

### Competitive Landscape

**Oracle Market Leaders (Unregulated):**
- Chainlink ($19B market leader, unregulated)
- RedStone, Pyth, Band Protocol (all unregulated)

**RWA-Specific Competitors:** NONE with global regulatory licenses = **BLUE OCEAN**

**Timeline Advantage:**
- Tomasz = 6-month licensing (Singapore MAS by June 2026)
- Competitors need 18-24 months minimum
- **18-24 month first-mover advantage** in "regulated RWA oracle" category

---

## PART 7: RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: Tomasz Unavailable or Declined

**Impact:** Viability drops to 4/10
**Mitigation:** Immediate outreach (Nov 10-15), backup CCO candidates identified
**Abort Trigger:** Tomasz firm "no" by Nov 30

---

### Risk 2: Competition Positioning Dilutes VC Credibility

**Impact:** LPs question Pre-A Club VC commitment
**Mitigation:** "Operator-investor" messaging, recuse from compliance investments, time-box to 18 months
**Communication:** Transparent LP communication about infrastructure strategy

---

### Risk 3: Timeline Compression (5 Months Too Tight)

**Impact:** Unprepared pitch, wasted competition opportunity
**Mitigation:** Aggressive milestone tracking, weekly checkpoints, PTC26-coordinator oversight
**Abort Trigger:** 3+ milestones missed by Jan 31

---

### Risk 4: Customer Validation Fails (Zero Pilots)

**Impact:** "Vaporware" perception, weak pitch credibility
**Mitigation:** PTC26 customer discovery (Feb 4-5), institutional warm intros via Tomasz network
**Pivot:** Position as "pre-revenue but licensed-in-process" if pilots don't materialize

---

### Risk 5: Singapore MAS Approval Delayed

**Impact:** "In-process" status weaker vs. "approved" competitors
**Mitigation:** Emphasize Tomasz's 10+ licenses, multi-jurisdiction strategy
**Messaging:** "First to file = first-mover advantage even if approval pending"

---

## PART 8: INTEGRATION WITH IPS26 STRATEGY

### Combined Value Proposition (4-Component Model)

| Component | Deliverable | Value | Status |
|-----------|------------|-------|--------|
| **Speaker Recruitment** | 5-7 Fortune 500 executives for "Shaping 2030" | €20-30K | 🔄 Ongoing |
| **Boardroom Briefing (Pre-A Club VC)** | 45-min institutional briefing on tokenized assets | £5-10K | ✅ Platform confirmed |
| **RealTimes Coverage** | Pre-event interviews + live coverage + post-event report | £40-60K | ⏳ Conditional |
| **RWA Compliance Startup** | Competition pitch + investor connections | £20K+ | 🆕 NEW (if pursuing) |

**Total Combined Value:** €120K + £65-100K = **~£210-270K over 12 months**
