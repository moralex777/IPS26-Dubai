CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. TOMASZ AVAILABILITY (Highest Impact)
   - Viability 9/10 WITH him, 4/10 WITHOUT
   - Must confirm by Nov 30
   - If declined: Abandon startup competition path

2. TIMELINE REALISM
   - 5 months to MVP + pitch is tight but feasible
   - Requires immediate execution (no delays)
   - CTO hiring is critical blocker (Jan 31 deadline)

3. CUSTOMER VALIDATION
   - 3 pilot agreements by Feb 28 (proof of product-market fit)
   - If zero pilots: Pivot to "pre-revenue" narrative

4. DELEGATION & EXECUTION
   - PTC26-coordinator manages tracking
   - Alexander: strategy + investor relations (not technical work)
   - Tomasz: compliance + licensing (not founder overhead)

---

RESOURCE ALLOCATION

If you pursue this:
- Time commitment: 5-10 hours/week (strategic + investor relations)
- Budget: ~$20-50K (incorporation, legal, MAS filing, tech hiring)
- Team: Tomasz (co-founder) + CTO (to be hired) + Alexander (strategy)
- Delegation: PTC26-ops manages tracking & logistics

---

FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY

If IPS26 competition successful:
- Investor introductions: 10+ conversations
- Seed round potential: $500K-2M (based on 3 pilot traction + regulatory moat)
- Enterprise ARR trajectory: Year 1 $500K-800K → Year 3 $5-10M
- Pre-A Club VC portfolio value: Demonstrates "infrastructure + regulatory expertise"

---

RISK SUMMARY

Highest Risks:
1. Tomasz unavailable (ABORT signal)
2. CTO hiring failure (No technical execution)
3. Zero customer validation (Vaporware signal)
4. Timeline compression (Rushed pitch quality)

Mitigations:
- Tomasz confirmation by Nov 30 (CRITICAL gate)
- Aggressive CTO recruitment (Jan 1-31 hiring window)
- PTC26 customer discovery (Feb 4-5) for pilot pipeline
- Weekly milestone tracking (catch delays early)

---

NEXT ACTION (TODAY - NOV 10)

[ ] Review startup competition strategy documents (30 min)
[ ] Send Rijenn inquiry (WhatsApp or email)
[ ] Send Tomasz availability check (email)
[ ] Set calendar reminder for Nov 30 decision deadline
[ ] Brief PTC26-coordinator on opportunity + timeline

DECISION FRAMEWORK

By November 30, you need to answer:

1. Is Tomasz available? (Yes/No)
2. Is Rijenn's competition favorable? (Yes/No)
3. Is timeline realistic? (Yes/No)

All YES = PURSUE
Any NO = PASS (focus on speaker recruitment + other components)

This is a high-upside, high-execution-risk opportunity. The 18-24 month regulatory moat is real, but only if execution is flawless.
