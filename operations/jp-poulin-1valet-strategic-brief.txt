NEXT STEPS

1. **Send Email NOW**
   - Direct send to JP (find email via LinkedIn/1Valet website)
   - Reference FPS25 collaboration by name
   - 20-minute call request

2. **LinkedIn Backup**
   - Connect/message on LinkedIn with shorter version of pitch
   - Creates redundancy if email bounces

3. **Track Response**
   - Expected: 3-5 business days
   - Log in IPS26-CONTRIBUTION-TRACKER.md
   - Mark as "Pending Response" or "Confirmed" when response received

4. **If Confirmed**

   - Request bio and headshot

5. **If No Response by Nov 17**
   - Follow-up email (friendly, not aggressive)

RISK MITIGATION

**If JP declines:**
- Activate secondary tier candidates (Annie Dean/CBRE, Cate Harris/Lendlease, Gary Holtzer/Hines)
- JP's decline would be surprising given personal connection + perfect fit

**If JP accepts but has schedule conflict:**
- Ask for recommendation: "Who else at 1Valet or in your network would fit this?"
- Valuable introduction either way

**If JP wants to defer to January:**
- Still acceptable (panel confirmation deadline is Dec 15, speakers needed by Jan 15)
- Lock commitment even if scheduling details slide
