## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This brief prepares Alexander for a strategic 20-30 minute discovery call with Rijenn Andres (IPS26 organizers). The call's primary objective is to lock panel scope ("Shaping 2030: AI, Cities & the New Urban Code") and establish Alexander's speaker recruitment commitment.

**Call Goal:** Transition from "I'm interested in speaking" → "I'm your strategic partner for speaker recruitment"

**Expected Outcomes:**

2. Speaker recruitment timeline agreed (research Nov 15-20, outreach Nov 20-Dec 5, confirmations by Dec 15)
3. Alexander positioned as indispensable value-add partner (vs. transactional speaker)
4. Next steps clarified (speaker introductions, moderator prep, logistical coordination)

**Key Success Metric:** Call concludes with Rijenn saying "Perfect, let's move forward with this" and confirmation that Alexander's moderator role is solid

---

## SECTION 1: CALL OBJECTIVES

### Primary Objectives (MUST Achieve)
1. **Confirm Panel Scope**
   - All 4 mandatory topics: AI/PropTech, Smart Cities, Climate Resilience, Wellness Design
   - Speaker count: 5-7 speakers (or alternative if modified)
   - Timeline: Research by Nov 20, outreach Nov 20-Dec 5, confirmations by Dec 15
   - Format: Confirmed as panel discussion (not boardroom briefing or other format)

2. **Lock Speaker Requirements**

   - Expertise: Addresses 1+ of the 4 mandatory topics
   - Geographic preference: Global, EMEA-focused, or MENA-heavy
   - Speaking experience: Demonstrated conference speaking (preferred but not mandatory)

3. **Establish Recruitment Commitment**
   - Confirm Alexander will deliver 5-7 confirmed speaker introductions
   - Set expectations: Research phase (Nov 15-20) → Outreach (Nov 20-Dec 5) → Confirmations (Dec 15)
   - Clarify: Alexander is recruiting speakers FOR IPS26, not speaking on behalf of speakers

### Secondary Objectives (SHOULD Achieve)

5. **Gauge RealTimes Media Partnership Interest**

6. **Build Trust & Confidence**
   - Reference FPS25 success (42.8% panel contribution, 3 of 7 speakers)
   - Demonstrate understanding of speaker recruitment complexity

## SECTION 3: KEY QUESTIONS FOR RIJENN (Prepared Sequence)

**Objective:** These 8 questions lock down scope, requirements, and timeline. Ask them naturally, not like an interrogation.

### Question 1: Topic Mandatory Coverage
**ASK:** "For the 'Shaping 2030' panel - are all four topics [AI/PropTech, Smart Cities, Climate Resilience, Wellness Design] mandatory for each speaker, or can speakers specialize in one or two areas?"

**WHY:** Determines if you need specialists (4 different expertise areas) vs. generalists (2-3 topics each)

**LISTEN FOR:**
- "All four are essential" → Need 5-7 distinct specialists
- "Topics should be covered overall" → Can have speakers cover 1-2 topics each
- "Emphasis on AI and smart cities" → Some topics less critical

**FOLLOW-UP IF NEEDED:** "So if we have strong AI + Smart Cities speakers, would Climate and Wellness be covered by co-panelists or separate discussions?"

---

### Question 2: Pre-Confirmed Speakers
**ASK:** "Do you already have any speakers confirmed or pending for this panel that I should coordinate with?"

**WHY:** Avoids recruiting speakers already on Rijenn's list; prevents awkward duplications

**LISTEN FOR:**
- Names of existing contacts (coordinate with them)
- Timelines from existing prospects ("waiting on confirmation from X")
- Expertise areas already locked down (focus recruitment on gaps)

**FOLLOW-UP IF NEEDED:** "Can you introduce me to them so I understand what areas we still need to cover?"

---

### Question 3: Geographic Focus
**ASK:** "Is there a geographic preference for the speaker panel? Global scope, EMEA-focused, MENA-heavy, or a mix?"

**WHY:** Determines which markets to focus recruitment efforts on

**LISTEN FOR:**
- "Global" → Draw from worldwide Fortune 500 companies
- "MENA-focused" → Prioritize speakers from UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, etc.
- "EU-strong with MENA balance" → Mix of European + Middle East representatives
- "Strategic mix" → Ensure geographic diversity across confirmed panel

**FOLLOW-UP IF NEEDED:** "Any countries or regions you particularly want represented?"

---

### Question 4: Seniority & Company Size
**ASK:** "For speaker quality, are you looking for C-suite level officers (Chief X roles), or are director/VP-level leaders acceptable if they have strong expertise?"

**WHY:** Confirms if Fortune 500 C-suite is mandatory or if high-quality experts at any level work

**LISTEN FOR:**
- "C-suite mandatory" → Focus only on Chief Officer titles
- "Open to director-level if exceptional" → Expands target universe
- "Mix is fine" → Balance of C-suite + director-level acceptable

**FOLLOW-UP IF NEEDED:** "And company size - Fortune 500 preferred, or can mid-market leaders (well-known but smaller companies) work?"

---

### Question 5: Avoiding Speakers
**ASK:** "Are there any companies or specific speakers you want to avoid? (e.g., direct competitors, regulatory conflicts, or previous bad experiences)"

**WHY:** Prevents wasting time recruiting inappropriate prospects

**LISTEN FOR:**
- Competitor names to exclude
- Companies with sponsorship conflicts
- Previously rejected speakers
- Any sensitive relationships

**FOLLOW-UP IF NEEDED:** "Got it, I'll make sure to avoid those in my outreach."

---

### Question 6: Direct Rijenn Introductions
**ASK:** "Do you have any direct relationships with speakers you'd like me to coordinate with, or should I rely on my network for cold outreach?"

**WHY:** Determines if Rijenn can fast-track some confirmations through her own network

**LISTEN FOR:**
- "I know some people in [topic area]" → Ask for introductions
- "You lead the outreach" → Cold outreach is acceptable approach
- List of specific contacts to reach out to

**FOLLOW-UP IF NEEDED:** "If you have any warm introductions, that would definitely help speed things up."

---

### Question 7: Timeline Flexibility
**ASK:** "My plan is to research prospects this week [Nov 15-20], launch outreach [Nov 20-Dec 5], and aim for confirmations by December 15. Is that timeline workable, or do you need anything adjusted?"

**WHY:** Confirms Alexander's proposed timeline aligns with IPS needs

**LISTEN FOR:**
- "Perfect timeline" → On track
- "Need confirmations earlier" → Accelerate to Dec 10 or even Dec 1
- "Can extend to January" → Relaxes deadline, allows for backup prospects
- "Need weekly updates" → Sets reporting cadence expectation

**FOLLOW-UP IF NEEDED:** "And once speakers confirm, how quickly do you need bios and headshots?"

---

### Question 8: Panel Format & Moderator Clarity
**ASK:** "Just to confirm - this is a panel discussion format with me moderating, correct? Or is this considering other formats like a boardroom briefing or fireside chat?"

**WHY:** Clarifies Alexander's role and format expectations (important for speaker recruitment angle)

**LISTEN FOR:**
- "Panel with you moderating" → Confirmed, focus recruitment on panelists, not additional moderators
- "Boardroom briefing" → Different format, Alexander is facilitator not panelist
- "Multiple sessions possible" → Could be both panel + boardroom

**FOLLOW-UP IF NEEDED:** "And I'm clear that my primary role is recruiting these speakers and moderating the discussion, right?"

---

## SECTION 4: TALKING POINTS (5 Core Sections)

### Talking Point 1: Alexander's Moderator Credibility (FPS25 + PTC25 Success)

**Opening:** "Rijenn, I want to make sure you know - I have recent experience moderating similar panels. In October, I moderated the Green Building panel at FPS25 Dubai, where I recruited and delivered 3 of the 7 speakers on that panel. That's 42.8% of the panel, which made me operationally indispensable to the event's success."

**Key Points:**
- FPS25: Panel moderator role, successfully recruited 3 speakers (42.8% of 7-speaker panel)
- Outcome: Panel was highly successful, speakers delivered strong content
- Experience: Comfortable with high-level audiences, speaker coordination, on-stage moderation
- Lesson Learned: Value comes from demonstrating contributions BEFORE requesting opportunities

**Why It Matters:** Establishes Alexander as proven moderator, not just a speaker seeking exposure

**If Rijenn Responds:** "That's impressive" → Acknowledge: "Happy to provide details or references"

---

### Talking Point 2: Speaker Recruitment Capability (Network + Process)

**Transition:** "Because of that FPS25 experience, I understand the complexity of speaker recruitment. I have a network of 500+ PropTech and real estate leaders across Europe, Middle East, and Asia. For the 'Shaping 2030' panel, I can leverage that network to identify and recruit 5-7 Fortune 500 executives who match your requirements."

**Key Points:**
- Network size: 500+ PropTech/real estate leaders (credible, proven network)
- Geographic reach: EU, MENA, Global (aligns with IPS26 audience)
- Speaker quality: C-suite officers at Fortune 500 companies (matches IPS26 standards)
- Process: Identify prospects with specific expertise, personalized outreach, confirmation tracking

**Why It Matters:** Positions Alexander as having both network and process to deliver

**If Rijenn Responds:** "How do you identify the right speakers?" → Explain: "I research Fortune 500 companies across the 4 topic areas, map their C-suite expertise to your panel topics, and personally reach out with a tailored value proposition"

---

### Talking Point 3: Panel Composition Understanding (4 Mandatory Topics)

**Transition:** "I've done my homework on your panel theme, 'Shaping 2030: AI, Cities & the New Urban Code.' I understand the four topics are critical: AI/PropTech innovation, smart cities integration, climate resilience, and wellness design. I'll make sure my speaker recommendations cover all four of these areas."

**Key Points:**
- Topic comprehension: All 4 topics essential to panel success
- Recruitment strategy: Identify speakers with expertise mapped to each topic
- Diversity: Mix of specialists (1-2 topics each) or generalists (2-4 topics)
- Quality: Ensure speakers can authentically discuss their expertise areas

**Why It Matters:** Shows Alexander understands the panel's strategic importance, not just recruiting warm bodies

**If Rijenn Responds:** "What if we can't fill all four topics?" → Respond: "Let's discuss which topics are most critical, and I'll prioritize accordingly. But I'll do my best to cover all four with strong speakers."

---

### Talking Point 4: Timeline Alignment & Execution Plan (Nov 15-Dec 15)

**Transition:** "Here's my execution plan to keep this on track. I'll spend November 15-20 researching Fortune 500 prospects across the four topic areas. Then November 20 through December 5, I'll do personalized outreach to approximately 10-15 qualified candidates. By December 15, I'll have 5-7 confirmed speakers with their bios and headshots ready for you."

**Key Points:**
- Research phase (Nov 15-20): Fortune 500 prospect identification, 15-20 qualified candidates
- Outreach phase (Nov 20-Dec 5): Personalized emails/LinkedIn outreach, 10-15 targets
- Confirmation phase (Dec 1-15): Track responses, confirm acceptances, collect docs
- Handoff: All confirmed speakers documented and introduced to Rijenn by Dec 15

**Why It Matters:** Specific timeline builds confidence Alexander will deliver on commitments

**If Rijenn Responds:** "That's tight, can you accelerate?" → Respond: "Absolutely. I can have initial research done by Nov 18 and start outreach by Nov 19 if needed. The key constraint is speaker response time (48-72 hours typical)."

---

### Talking Point 5: Value Positioning - Partnership vs. Transactional Speaker

**Transition:** "Rijenn, I want to be clear about how I see this engagement. I'm not just coming on as a speaker to promote myself. I'm positioning myself as a strategic partner - someone who recruits your panel speakers, moderates the discussion, and leverages my network to make the session successful. That's how I approached FPS25, and that's what I want to deliver for IPS26."

**Key Points:**
- Partnership mindset: Alexander is invested in panel success, not personal visibility
- Value delivery: Speaker recruitment is the primary value, moderation is secondary
- Network leverage: Can introduce pre/post-panel networking opportunities
- Outcome focus: Panel success metrics matter more than speaker roster prestige

**Why It Matters:** Differentiates Alexander from transactional speakers, positions him as strategic ally to IPS organizers

**If Rijenn Responds:** "We love that approach" → Acknowledge: "Great. Then let's lock down scope and timeline so I can deliver excellent speakers."

---

## SECTION 5: PREPARATION MATERIALS & REFERENCE DOCS

### Reference 1: FPS25 Success Model (If Discussion Goes Deep)
**Talking Point:** "At FPS25, here's what I did: I identified the Green Building panel gaps, researched 15-20 Fortune 500 executives with sustainability expertise, reached out to 10 prospects, and delivered 3 confirmed speakers. The panel was successful, audience engagement was strong, and it positioned me as a key asset to the event."

**Proof Points You Can Reference:**
- 42.8% speaker contribution (3 of 7 panel members)
- €90K total value demonstrated at FPS25
- 6 different contribution areas (not just one)
- Professional execution (panel research, speaker prep, on-stage moderation)

### Reference 2: Speaker Archetype Examples (If Asked "Who Would You Target?")

**Example Response:** "Let me give you some examples. For AI/PropTech, I'd look at CDOs at companies like Zillow or WeWork. For Smart Cities, I'd target CIOs at Cisco or Siemens. For Climate Resilience, I'd reach out to Chief Sustainability Officers at Brookfield or Schneider Electric. For Wellness Design, CMOs at luxury hospitality brands like Four Seasons or Marriott. Does that direction feel right?"

**Key:** Names real, credible companies to demonstrate familiarity with the landscape

### Reference 3: Fortune 500 Prospect Examples (If Asked "Can You Actually Get These People?")

**Example Response:** "Yes, absolutely. At my seniority level and through my network, I have direct access to C-suite executives at these companies. For example, I've worked with [real example if you have one], and I know how to approach these conversations in a way that demonstrates value. It's not about asking for a favor - it's about showing them why this panel is worth their time."

**Key:** Confident but not boastful; acknowledge that relationship and credibility are what open doors

---

## SECTION 8: TROUBLESHOOTING SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Rijenn Says "Your Timeline Is Too Fast"
**Problem:** She wants confirmations extended beyond Dec 15

**Response:** "I understand. What's the ideal confirmation timeline from your perspective? I'm flexible and can adjust research/outreach to match your needs. The key for me is knowing the deadline upfront so I can manage the campaign accordingly."

**Action:** Adjust timeline to accommodate, but lock in NEW deadline (e.g., Jan 15 instead of Dec 15). Document in tracker.

---

### Scenario 2: Rijenn Says "We Have No Pre-Confirmed Speakers"
**Problem:** IPS26 has no existing speaker relationships to coordinate with

**Response:** "Perfect. That gives me full freedom to identify the best-fit speakers from my network. I'll have complete discretion on who to approach, which actually works in our favor - I can be strategic about getting the highest-quality speakers."

**Action:** Confirm this is accurate, proceed with independent research and outreach.

---

### Scenario 3: Rijenn Says "Geography Doesn't Matter"
**Problem:** She's open to global speakers, removes geographic constraint

**Response:** "Got it. I'll source globally but make sure we have geographic diversity - mix of European, MENA, and other regions. That way you get a truly international panel perspective."

**Action:** Document "global scope, balanced diversity preferred" in tracker.

---

### Scenario 4: Rijenn Says "We Need C-Suite Mandatory"
**Problem:** She's strict on C-level requirement

**Response:** "Understood. I'll focus exclusively on Chief Officer titles - CDOs, CMOs, CSOs, CIOs, and similar C-suite roles. That's actually my sweet spot in terms of network access."

**Action:** Document "C-Suite Mandatory" and adjust research scope accordingly.

---

### Scenario 5: Rijenn Asks About Media Partnership
**Problem:** She asks about RealTimes coverage

**Response:** "Great question. Yes, RealTimes is launching in January 2026 and can provide professional media coverage for IPS26 - video interviews pre-event, live coverage during the event, and comprehensive post-event content. That's a separate conversation, but absolutely something we could explore. Would you like to discuss that now, or should we lock in speaker recruitment first and come back to media partnership separately?"

**Action:**
- If she wants to discuss now: Be enthusiastic, mention "15+ pre-event interviews, daily coverage, post-event report"
- If she wants to focus on speakers: Agree, table media discussion for later (after speaker confirmations locked)

---

### Scenario 6: Rijenn Says "We Already Have Strong AI/PropTech Speakers"
**Problem:** Some topics already have confirmed speakers

**Response:** "Excellent. That's helpful to know. So we should focus recruitment on [other topics], right? And I'll make sure to coordinate with whoever is doing AI/PropTech so there's no topic overlap or redundancy. Can you introduce me to them so I understand their angle?"

**Action:** Adjust recruitment strategy to focus on gaps identified by Rijenn. Request intros to existing speakers for coordination.

---

### Scenario 7: Rijenn Seems Skeptical of Dec 15 Confirmations
**Problem:** She doubts Alexander can deliver 5-7 confirmations that fast

**Response:** "I understand the skepticism. Let me assure you - I've done this before. At FPS25 Dubai in October, I recruited and confirmed 3 speakers for a panel in a similar timeframe. I have Fortune 500 relationships and a proven process for identifying, reaching out, and converting speakers quickly. If it helps, I can send you a reference from the FPS25 organizers about my delivery."

**Action:** Offer to provide FPS25 reference if needed. Commit to weekly progress updates to build confidence.

---

## SECTION 9: CALL COMMUNICATION STYLE GUIDE

### DO:
- ✅ Be confident but not arrogant ("I can deliver this, and here's how")
- ✅ Show genuine interest in Rijenn's vision for the panel
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions (8 key questions in Section 3)
- ✅ Reference FPS25 success and lessons learned
- ✅ Offer flexibility on timeline and scope (within reason)
- ✅ Take detailed notes (shows you're serious)
- ✅ Confirm action items and next steps at end of call
- ✅ Be specific with timeline ("Nov 15-20 research, Nov 20-Dec 5 outreach")

### DON'T:
- ❌ Sound desperate or over-eager ("Please, I really need this opportunity")
- ❌ Over-promise ("I can get any speaker you want, guaranteed")
- ❌ Rush through topics (let conversation breathe naturally)
- ❌ Dismiss her concerns ("That won't be a problem")
- ❌ Make up examples or fake references (stick to FPS25 truth)
- ❌ Talk about yourself too much (focus on panel success and Rijenn's needs)
- ❌ Forget to ask clarifying questions (8 key questions must be asked)
- ❌ End call without confirmed action items and next steps

---
