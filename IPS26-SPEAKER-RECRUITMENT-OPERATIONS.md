## SECTION 7: RISK MITIGATION FRAMEWORK

### Risk 1: Low Response Rate (<25%)
**Warning Sign:** After 10 days, <2-3 responses to first 10 outreach emails
**Root Causes:** Wrong audience, weak email messaging, timing issue (holiday season)
**Mitigation:**
1. Analyze non-responders: Are they the right seniority/expertise?
2. Adjust email messaging: Add more specific value proposition, different angle
3. Expand target list: Identify 10 additional backup prospects immediately
4. Alternative outreach: Try LinkedIn InMail, company assistant outreach, or warm intro from network

**Escalation:** Alert Alexander by Nov 25 if response rate is <20%

### Risk 2: Acceptance Rate <50%
**Warning Sign:** After first confirmations, acceptance rate dropping (e.g., 1 of 5 responding yes)
**Root Causes:** Panel positioning weak, timing conflicts, speaker preferences different, value unclear
**Mitigation:**
1. Offer format flexibility: "Panel discussion, boardroom briefing, or fireside chat - what works for you?"
2. Reference Rijenn authority: "Rijenn Andres from IPS organizers would love to discuss details"
3. Highlight speaker quality: "You'll be alongside [Confirmed Speaker 1] and [Confirmed Speaker 2]"
4. Escalate to Rijenn: Request direct introduction to 2-3 speaker prospects she knows (speed boost)

**Escalation:** Alert Alexander by Dec 5 if acceptance rate is <30%

### Risk 3: <5 Confirmations by Dec 15
**Warning Sign:** As Dec 15 approaches, <5 confirmations locked
**Root Causes:** Campaign underperformance, timing issues, lower-than-expected acceptance
**Mitigation Options:**
1. **Accelerate Backup Prospects:** Deploy second wave of outreach to 10 backup speakers (Dec 10+)
2. **Request Rijenn Intros:** Ask Rijenn for 2-3 direct speaker introductions (she may know confirmed speakers)
3. **Extend Timeline:** Propose to Rijenn that confirmations extend through Jan 15 (accept later responses)
4. **Topic Flexibility:** Confirm with Rijenn if all 4 topics mandatory or if 3 topics + strong speakers sufficient
5. **Panel Redesign:** Propose smaller panel (4 speakers) if 5-7 not achievable

**Decision Point:** Alexander + Rijenn decide on contingency plan by Dec 15

### Risk 4: Critical Topic Underrepresented
**Warning Sign:** After 5+ confirmations, one topic has no speaker (e.g., no Wellness Design expert)
**Root Causes:** Fewer prospects available for that topic, lower acceptance in that vertical
**Mitigation:**
1. Targeted outreach: Deploy PTC26-writer with 3-5 specific prospects for missing topic
2. Multi-topic speakers: Ask confirmed speakers if they have expertise in missing topic (some may have secondary expertise)
3. Topic substitution: Confirm with Rijenn if panel can adjust from 4 to 3 topics if necessary
4. Backup list: Have 2-3 backup prospects per topic ready for emergency deployment

**Escalation:** Alert Rijenn immediately if topic at risk of being completely unrepresented

### Risk 5: Speaker Dropout (Late Cancellation)
**Warning Sign:** Confirmed speaker cancels in Dec or Jan (illness, conflicts, company change)
**Root Causes:** Scheduling conflicts emerge, company priorities change, personal circumstances
**Mitigation:**
1. **Backup List Readiness:** Maintain 5-10 "confirmed interested, just waiting" prospects (not yet invited to commit)
2. **Quick Deployment:** Can reach out to backup prospect with 1-week confirmation turnaround
3. **Placeholder Speaker:** Rijenn may have backup speakers; request immediately if dropout occurs
4. **Topic Flexibility:** If dropout speaker was critical for one topic, identify alternate topic angle in replacement speaker

**Prevention:** Monitor confirmed speakers for any red flags (company changes, LinkedIn activity changes) in Dec/Jan
