## Conversation Transcript

```
[09:38] Alex Morari: Quick question: what's the PRIMARY focus you want -
is it more about AI/PropTech innovation, smart city case studies,
climate resilience tech, or wellness-driven design?
This helps me identify the right speaker profiles from my network.

[09:38] Alex Morari: what i mean is:

[09:39] Rijenn: Well its mix of all of that

[09:39] Alex Morari: the current scope covers AI + smart cities +
climate + wellness (4 big topics). Top-tier C-level speakers
usually prefer focused panels where they can showcase specific expertise.
Would you be open to narrowing to one core theme?

[09:39] Rijenn: Panel discussion must contains this different field of work

[09:39] Alex Morari: ok, if it must it will :)

[09:40] Alex Morari: current business focus/based-in: experts can be
based/active in any market globally i understand, right?
key is they bring interesting perspective, ideas, logos, etc.

[09:40] Rijenn: That's why its challenging its a mix of all of this
part plus their backgrounds and company must also high end

[09:41] Rijenn: Yes and big companies mainly with different fields
```

## Critical Takeaways

### Panel Scope Decision (FINAL)
✅ **All 4 topics MUST remain**: AI + Smart Cities + Climate Resilience + Wellness Design
- Non-negotiable requirement from Rijenn
- This is NOT a narrowing opportunity (initial strategy did not work)
- Implies need for "generalist" speakers OR multi-disciplinary panel composition

### Speaker Profile Requirements
- **Company Tier**: "Big companies" + "high end" = Fortune 500 / Global leaders / Tier-1 platforms
- **Discipline**: Multi-field backgrounds (speakers who bridge multiple domains)
- **Geographic Scope**: Global acceptable (no MENA-only requirement mentioned)
- **Priority Signals**: Prestige/logo value emphasized ("logos", "high end", "big companies")

### Recruitment Challenge Level
- Rijenn explicitly: "That's why it's challenging"
- Acknowledges the difficulty of finding speakers who can credibly cover all 4 domains
- Pragmatic about scope vs. feasibility trade-off

## Personality Analysis

### Communication Style
- **Direct**: Minimal elaboration, gets to point quickly
- **Decisive**: Rejects suggested alternatives without debate
- **Pragmatic**: Acknowledges constraints ("That's why it's challenging")
- **WhatsApp-native**: Brief, conversational tone (not formal)

### Decision-Making Pattern
- **Requirements-first**: Knows what she wants (scope, quality level, diversity)
- **Non-negotiable on scope**: Strategic advisory politely deflected
- **Flexible on means**: Open to geographic flexibility, global speakers
- **Prestige-conscious**: Logo/brand value appears important

### Negotiation Stance
- Listens to suggestions (didn't dismiss Alexander's focus proposal harshly)
- But maintains boundary ("Panel discussion must contains this different field of work")
- Not seeking to redesign panel, seeking speaker recruitment support
- Implicit: "Help me find great speakers for this exact scope, not redesign it"

### Relationship Dynamics
- Professional but warm ("ok, if it must it will :)")
- Appreciates clarity-seeking (answered questions directly)
- Values time efficiency (3-minute exchange covering 4 key points)

## Strategic Implications

### For Speaker Recruitment
1. **Generalist Unicorn Hunt**: Need speakers with credible expertise across 2-3 of the 4 domains
   - CDOs who understand climate tech + smart cities
   - CMOs at major PropTech firms (have all 4 perspectives)
   - Chief Innovation Officers at global real estate platforms

2. **High-Bar Entry**: Fortune 500 / Tier-1 companies only
   - Eliminates mid-market or emerging players
   - Narrows to ~200-300 global candidates vs. 10,000+

3. **Logo Plays**: Rijenn values prestige, so speaker announcements will carry weight
   - First speaker announcement will be critical (sets tone for others)
   - Should prioritize "marquee names" over emerging thought leaders

### For Alexander's Positioning
- ✅ Accepted as strategic advisor (willingness to engage with suggestions)
- ✅ Recognized need for network leverage ("identify right speaker profiles from my network")
- ⚠️ Not reforming panel scope (clear boundaries from Rijenn)
- 🎯 Clear role: Speaker matchmaker, not panel redesigner

### Next Steps
1. **Identify "Generalist" Speaker Archetypes**: CInO, CSO, CMO at global PropTech/real estate platforms
2. **High-company-tier targeting**: Fortune 500 real estate + tech firms
3. **Multi-domain credibility check**: Can each prospect speak to 2-3 of the 4 topics?
4. **Prestige/logo value assessment**: Will announcement carry weight for IPS26 positioning?
