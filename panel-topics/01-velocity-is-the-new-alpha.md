# Velocity is the New Alpha: Executing at the Speed of Capital

**Event:** IPS Congress 2026
**Date:** Day 1 - Sunday, April 13, 2026
**Time:** 4:40 PM - 5:00 PM
**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Track:** Institutional Investor Conference Track
**Type:** Executive Panel

## Panel Description

How execution speed defines the competitive edge in modern markets. Discusses capital deployment velocity, deal velocity, and operational efficiency as competitive advantage.

---

## Why This Topic is Original

This completely reframes competitive advantage itself. Instead of traditional metrics like yield, location, or deal size, it positions *execution speed* as the primary value driver. It's a bold thesis that turns conventional wisdom on its head.

## Possible Discussion Points

### 1. Redefining Alpha in Modern Markets
- **Traditional alpha sources** (market timing, asset selection, leverage)
- **Speed as the new differentiation factor** in commoditized markets
- **First-mover advantage** vs. fast-follower strategies

- **Cloud-based collaboration tools** for distributed teams
- **The technology stack** required for institutional-grade velocity

### 3. Organizational Design for Rapid Execution
- **Decision-making frameworks** that enable speed
  - Delegation vs. centralization
  - Pre-approved investment parameters
  - Emergency capital deployment protocols
- **Team structure** optimized for velocity
  - Co-located vs. distributed teams
  - Cross-functional rapid response units
- **Culture of urgency** without sacrificing diligence
- **Training and simulation** for speed readiness

### 4. Risk Management at High Velocity
- **Balancing speed with prudence**
  - What corners can't be cut?
  - Risk frameworks for fast decisions
- **Pre-vetted deal pipelines** and continuous underwriting
- **Real-time risk monitoring** post-deployment
- **Kill switches and circuit breakers** for rapid capital deployment
- **Lessons from failures**: When speed killed deals

### 5. Capital Market Infrastructure Supporting Velocity
- **Dubai's regulatory environment** enabling rapid execution
  - Fast-track approvals
  - Digital registration systems
  - Streamlined compliance
- **Banking infrastructure** for same-day capital movement
- **Legal frameworks** supporting expedited transactions
- **Cross-border coordination** mechanisms

### 6. Competitive Dynamics in Speed-Driven Markets
- **Market segmentation**: Where velocity matters most
  - Distressed assets
  - Off-market opportunities
  - Competitive bidding situations
- **Velocity as barrier to entry** for slower competitors
- **The arms race**: When everyone optimizes for speed
- **Sustainability concerns**: Can this pace be maintained?

### 7. Measuring and Benchmarking Execution Speed
- **Key velocity metrics** for institutional investors
  - Days from LOI to close
  - Capital deployment rate
  - Decision-to-execution timeframes
- **Industry benchmarks** and performance standards
- **Velocity scorecards** for fund managers
- **Reporting speed performance** to LPs and stakeholders

### 8. Future of Speed in Real Estate Capital
- **AI-driven autonomous execution** (2030 outlook)
- **Instant settlement** via blockchain
- **24/7 global deal flow** and continuous markets
- **The human role** in high-velocity environments
- **Regulatory evolution** to support (or constrain) velocity
