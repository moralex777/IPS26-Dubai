---

## ⏹️ TO SKIP (Red - Items Explicitly Out of Scope)

### 1. RIYADH PROPTECH SUMMIT PLANNING (NOT APPLICABLE NOW)
Status: SKIPPED - OUT OF SCOPE FOR NOVEMBER/DECEMBER
Reason: Riyadh PropTech Summit mentioned in IPS26 strategy (Q2 2026) is aspirational post-April planning
Note: This was flagged in playbook as Phase 4 long-term positioning (post-April 2026 leverage)
User tempo: 1-2 day execution window does NOT support multi-event simultaneous planning
Action: Skip for now, revisit May 2026 if IPS26 execution successful

### 2. 6-WEEK SPEAKER OUTREACH TIMELINE (WRONG TEMPO)
Status: REJECTED in favor of condensed timeline
Original plan: 6-week phased outreach (user flagged as wrong tempo)
Replacement: Condensed 2-week outreach window
New timeline: Nov 15-20 (research), Nov 20-Dec 5 (outreach), confirmations by Dec 15
Reason: User can execute 1-2 day cycles, not 6-week linear timelines

### 3. EXTENDED PRE-EVENT MEDIA PARTNERSHIPS (CONDITIONAL)
Status: DEPRIORITIZED until moderator role confirmed
Original plan: Comprehensive RealTimes media partnership proposal
Current status: Hold until Feb PTC26 execution demonstrates media capability
Timeline: Only activate media partnership IF moderator role confirmed by Dec 15
Reason: Media partnership is secondary value layer; primary objective is moderator slot

## KEY INSIGHTS FROM DISCOVERY CONVERSATION (Nov 10)

From Rijenn Interaction Log:
1. **All 4 topics MANDATORY** - No narrowing accepted
   - AI/PropTech + Smart Cities + Climate Resilience + Wellness Design (all required)
   - Rijenn was firm: "Panel discussion must contains this different field of work"

2. **Fortune 500/Tier-1 prestige prioritized**

   - Logo/prestige value appears more important than emerging thought leaders

3. **Geographic flexibility accepted**
   - Global speakers acceptable, global reach preferred
   - No MENA-only requirement mentioned

4. **Multi-disciplinary expertise required**
   - Speakers need to bridge 2-3+ of the 4 domains
   - "Generalist unicorn" archetype preferred
   - Rijenn acknowledged challenge: "That's why it's challenging"

5. **Communication style**

## USER TEMPO ALIGNMENT

✅ ALIGNED WITH 1-2 DAY EXECUTION CAPACITY

Original problem flagged by user:
- "Previous analysis proposed 6-week speaker outreach (WRONG TEMPO)"
- User can execute 1-2 day timelines (NOT 6 weeks)

Solution implemented:
- Compressed speaker outreach to 2-week window: Nov 15-20 (research) → Nov 20-Dec 5 (outreach)
- Daily checkpoint structure (Nov 10, Nov 15, Nov 20, Dec 1, Dec 15)
- Parallel execution (speaker research + Rijenn monitoring + prep work)
- Clear trigger points (Nov 11-15: Rijenn response, Nov 15: launch decision)

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### RISK 1: Rijenn doesn't respond by Nov 15
Mitigation: Send follow-up email
Action: Draft + send follow-up Nov 15 (1-hour task)

### RISK 2: Speaker outreach < 3 confirmations by Dec 5
Mitigation: Activate Secondary Tier candidates
Action: Launch Phase 2 outreach to candidates 6-14
Timeline: Dec 1-15

### RISK 3: Moderator slot not confirmed by Dec 15
Mitigation: Clarify status with Rijenn
Action: Direct email asking for confirmation status
Decision: If no confirmation, reassess IPS26 participation vs. focus on PTC26

### RISK 4: Simultaneous PTC26 execution (Feb 4-5)
Mitigation: Parallel project management
Coordinator: PTC26-coordinator manages both IPS26 + PTC26
Timeline: IPS26 speaker outreach (Nov-Dec) parallel with PTC26 preparation (Jan-Feb)

---

## NEXT ACTIONS SUMMARY

IMMEDIATE (Nov 10-15):
1. Monitor Rijenn response (expected Nov 11-15)
2. If discovery call offered: Confirm attendance + prepare talking points (30 min)
3. If no response by Nov 15: Draft follow-up email (30 min)

NEXT PHASE (Nov 15-20):
1. Draft 5 personalized speaker outreach emails to Tier-1 prospects (4 hours)
2. Send emails + LinkedIn outreach (1 hour)

EXECUTION PHASE (Nov 20-Dec 15):
1. Track speaker confirmations in contribution tracker
2. Send formal invitations to confirmed speakers
3. Monitor for Dec 15 milestone (moderator role + 5-7 confirmations)

---
