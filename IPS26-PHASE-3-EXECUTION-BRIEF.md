**Escalation Path:** Email both Rijenn (rijenn@ipscongress.com) and Azza (azza@ipscongress.com)

### Milestone 2: Panel Scope Finalized (Nov 15-20)
**Success Criteria:**

3. Geographic preference: Global, EMEA-focused, or MENA-heavy?

5. Any speakers you want to avoid (competitors, regulatory conflicts)?

**If Panel Scope Unclear:**

- 5-7 speakers confirmed (70-100% of target range)

- Speaker count confirmed (5-7 or modified)
- Timeline confirmed (research Nov 15-20, outreach Nov 20-Dec 5)

**GO Path:**

- Begin speaker research on Nov 15

**NO-GO Path (If scope unclear):**
- Request second call with Rijenn to clarify panel requirements
- Do not deploy research agent until scope is locked

**Decision Owner:** Alexander (in consultation with PTC26-coordinator)

### Decision Point 2: Speaker Confirmations ≥5? (Dec 15)
**What triggers this decision:**
- Dec 15 confirmation deadline reached
- Count confirmed speakers: ≥5 = SUCCESS, <5 = ESCALATION

**GO Path (≥5 confirmations):**
- Celebrate milestone in tracker
- Begin speaker introduction delivery to Rijenn

- Log success metrics in tracker

**ESCALATION Path (<5 confirmations):**

**Decision Owner:** Alexander (in consultation with PTC26-coordinator)

### Decision Point 3: Moderator Role Finalized? (Dec 20)
**What triggers this decision:**
- Rijenn confirms Alexander's moderator role is locked
- Format confirmed (IPS Conference panel, Institutional Investor Summit boardroom, or both)
- Speaker introductions successfully delivered to Rijenn

**GO Path:**
- Begin detailed moderator prep (panel research, speaker briefings, talking points)

## BLOCKERS & ESCALATION PATHS

### Blocker 1: Rijenn Doesn't Respond (Nov 15)
**If no response to registration confirmation by Nov 15:**
- Send follow-up email to rijenn@ipscongress.com + azza@ipscongress.com
- Subject: "IPS26 Forms Submitted + Speaker Recruitment Interest"
- Reference: Forms submitted Nov 10, awaiting discovery call scheduling
- Include: Brief speaker recruitment offer (5-7 Fortune 500 prospects)
- Call to Action: Request call scheduling or next steps

**Timeline:** If no response by Nov 18, consider alternate contact (Azza), or escalate to event website

### Blocker 2: Panel Scope Not Finalized by Nov 20
**If Rijenn delays scope confirmation past Nov 20:**
- Begin research on best-guess scope (all 4 topics, 5-7 speakers)
- Maintain Nov 20 outreach start date (don't lose momentum)
- Request Rijenn confirm scope by Nov 22 at latest
- Be prepared to pivot speaker list if scope changes mid-research

**Timeline Risk:** Pushes confirmations to Dec 18-20 (tighter deadline)

### Blocker 3: <3 Confirmations by Dec 15
**If confirmations fall below 3 by Dec 15:**
- Alert Alexander with options:
  - Option A: Request Rijenn for 2-3 direct speaker introductions (speed method)
  - Option B: Extend confirmation window to Jan 15 (accept later confirmations)
  - Option C: Modify panel scope (fewer speakers, different focus)

**Risk Assessment:** <3 confirms signals campaign needs adjustment (targeting, messaging, or reach)

### Blocker 4: Speaker Campaign Not Resonating (<25% response rate)
**If fewer than 2-3 speakers respond positively to first 10-15 outreach:**
- Analyze response patterns (which speakers engaged, which ignored)
- Adjust outreach messaging (referencing Rijenn, emphasizing panel prestige, or topic angle)
- Expand speaker target list (identify 10 additional backup prospects)
- Deploy PTC26-writer agent for messaging optimization

**Root Cause Analysis:** Could indicate:
- Weak speaker fit (wrong seniority, wrong topic expertise)
- Weak email messaging (not compelling enough)
- Wrong contact channel (email vs. LinkedIn vs. phone)
- Timing issue (busy season, holiday period)
