## ⏹️ WHAT TO SKIP (Red - Out of Scope)

1. Riyadh PropTech Summit
   Reason: Aspirational Q2 2026 planning, not November/December priority
   Action: Skip for now, revisit May 2026 if IPS26 successful

2. 6-Week Speaker Outreach
   Reason: WRONG TEMPO - User can execute 1-2 day cycles
   Replacement: Compressed 2-week window (Nov 15 → Dec 5)

3. Extended Media Partnerships (for now)
   Reason: Conditional on moderator slot confirmation
   Timeline: Only activate if moderator role confirmed by Dec 15
