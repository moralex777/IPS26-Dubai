SUBJECT: IPS 2026 VIP Speaker Invitation - Response

---

Good afternoon Dear Rijenn, to meet you, Azza!

Thank you for the invitation to IPS 2026.

I'm genuinely honored and very interested. I've reviewed both tracks, and they align perfectly with my current work.

I'd be keen to participate in both the IPS Conference and the Institutional Investor Summit. Happy to discuss which format works best, boardroom briefing, panel, or roundtable. I'm sure of best value to such events as yours in the capacity of Panel Moderator and have some experience in Europe and Dubai as well. Happy to find out other ways I could contribute.

I'd love a brief call with you this week to discuss panel topics and how to structure my inputs. Feel free to suggest convenient time slots for next step. I'll do my best to accommodate.

Looking forward to it.

Best regards,

Alexander Morari, MRICS

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM DRAFT:
✓ Direct greeting to both Rijenn and Azza
✓ Added panel moderator positioning (stronger value prop than draft)
✓ Mentioned Europe + Dubai experience
✓ More flexible on next steps ("feel free to suggest convenient time slots")
✓ Better tone (less formal, more collaborative)

NEXT STEPS:
- Wait for response from Rijenn (expected Nov 8-10)
- Prepare for discovery call talking points
- Review IPS26-STRATEGY-PLAYBOOK.md for call preparation
