WHATSAPP CONFIRMATION TO RIJENN
Date: November 10, 2025
Recipient: Rijenn Andres + Azza Al Qahwaji

========================================
MESSAGE DRAFT
========================================

Hi Rijenn,

Thanks for the heads up on the timeline. I've just completed both registration forms as requested:

✅ IPS Conference Track (Panel Moderator)
✅ Institutional Investor Summit (Boardroom Moderator)

Quick note: I noticed the agenda page shows "No sessions found for this filter" - likely still in publication phase. Once the session details are published, I'd appreciate receiving those so I can position optimally across both tracks.

I'm flexible with timing and looking forward to learning more about the panel topics and logistics. Feel free to reach out if you need any additional information from my end.

Thanks again for the opportunity!

Alexander

Thanks!
Alexander
