Subject: IPS PropTech Startups Competition Details - Inquiry

Hi Rijenn,

Great call on the "Shaping 2030" panel speaker support - we're moving quickly on that front.

I had another question while reviewing the IPS26 program. I noticed "PropTech Startups" is one of the five core pillars for 2026. I'm curious about the details on this pillar:

1. **Competition Structure:** Is this a pitch competition (live presentations) or startup showcase (booth demos)? How long are pitches?

2. **Application Deadline:** When do startup applications close? What's the timeline for finalist announcements?

3. **Eligibility:** Any stage restrictions? (pre-revenue, seed-stage only, etc?) Geographic restrictions?

4. **Judging Criteria:** What criteria do judges evaluate? (innovation, traction, team, other?)

5. **Prize/Benefits:** Cash prizes? Investment introductions? Media coverage? Speaking slots?

We're exploring a compliance infrastructure startup in the tokenization space (RWA oracle) that could be a strong fit for the IPS26 institutional investor audience. I want to understand if this would be a good competition entry before we move forward.

Would love to learn more about how this pillar works this year.

Best,
