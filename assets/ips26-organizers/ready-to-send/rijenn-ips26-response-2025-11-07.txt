Subject: IPS 2026 VIP Speaker Invitation

Dear Rijenn,

Thank you for the invitation to IPS 2026 — I'm genuinely honored and very interested. I've reviewed both tracks, and they align perfectly with my current work.

I'd be keen to participate in both the IPS Conference (speaking to the institutional playbook shift in real estate) and the Institutional Investor Summit (capital allocation trends and alternative structures). Happy to discuss which format works best — boardroom briefing, panel, or roundtable.

I'd love a brief call with you this week to discuss panel topics and how to structure the speaking role. Are you available Thursday or Friday (Nov 9-10)?

Looking forward to it.

Best regards,
