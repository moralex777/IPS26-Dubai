Subject: RWA Oracle Project - IPS26 Opportunity & Timeline Check

Hi Tomasz,

I wanted to touch base on the RWA oracle project we discussed back in October. I have an exciting development that could accelerate the timeline.

IPS Congress 2026 (April 13-15, Dubai) features a "PropTech Startups" competition pillar as part of their 5 core programming tracks. I'm moderating on both tracks (Panel + Boardroom), and they have 40,000+ institutional attendees—sovereign wealth funds, pensions, family offices.

**Here's the opportunity:**

IPS26 would be a **perfect launch platform** for the RWA oracle startup:
- Audience = institutional investors (exact target customer for compliance oracle)
- Timing = April 2026 (6 months out, realistic for MVP + pilot validation)
- Value = Investor introductions + media coverage + potential partnerships

**Timeline feasibility check:**

For the startup to be competition-ready by April 2026, we'd need:
1. **Nov-Dec 2025:** Company formation + Singapore MAS licensing research
2. **Jan 2026:** CTO hired, MVP development
3. **Feb 2026:** 3 institutional pilot agreements (customer validation)
4. **Mar 2026:** Pitch deck finalized
5. **Apr 13-15:** Pitch at IPS26 competition

**Critical ask:** Is this timeline realistic for you? Are you still available to co-found this with:
- Start date: November 1 or January 1, 2026?
- 18-month runway (to build institutional moat before Chainlink catches up)?
- Singapore-first licensing strategy (using your existing MAS relationships)?

I know you mentioned the project has been in limbo since October. Before I commit resources to the IPS26 path, I need to know if you're still interested and if the Nov or Jan timeline works for you.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
Alexander

**Notes for Alexander:**
- This inquiry is HIGH-STAKES - Tomasz availability is the critical success factor
- Success criteria: Tomasz confirms either Nov 1 or Jan 1 availability + interest in IPS26 as launch platform
- If Tomasz declines: Viability drops to 4/10 - recommend abandoning startup competition path
- Tone: Professional, respectful of his time, clear decision criteria
- Expected response: 48-72 hours (Tomasz typically responds quickly)
