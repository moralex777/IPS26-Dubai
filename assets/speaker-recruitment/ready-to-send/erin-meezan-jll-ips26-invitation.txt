Net-zero buildings at institutional scale: IPS Congress April panel

Erin,

Quick context: IPS Congress runs April 13-15 in Dubai and draws 40,000+ institutional investors, developers, and policymakers. The main panel is "Shaping 2030: AI, Cities & the New Urban Code"  weaving together climate resilience, wellness design, smart cities tech, and AI-enabled real estate.

Why I'm writing: Your work on carbon-negative models and regenerative design at JLL is foundational to exactly this conversation. Net-zero buildings aren't a silo anymore. They're the connective tissue between AI infrastructure, city planning, and wellness outcomes.

What's in it for JLL: Direct access to institutional capital and MENA developers making sustainability commitments. 150+ media reps covering climate-focused infrastructure decisions. A platform to reinforce JLL's thought leadership on what institutional real estate actually looks like in 2030.

The setup: This isn't a climate panel with specialists in one domain. It's a genuine conversation between leaders who understand how multiple forces intersect in urban development.

What I need: 20 minutes to walk through attendee breakdown, co-speaker profiles, and coverage expectations. Confirmation needed by mid-January.

Does this resonate?
