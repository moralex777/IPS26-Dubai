Subject: IPS Congress 2026 Dubai - Smart Cities & Real Estate Innovation Panel

Hi Priya,

I came across your recent work at Urban AI Labs on adaptive city infrastructure, and it caught my attention immediately. The way you're approaching real estate tech integration is exactly what the PropTech ecosystem needs.

I'm coordinating speaker recruitment for IPS Congress 2026 (April 13-15, Dubai), and I think you'd be perfect for our Smart Cities & Real Estate Innovation panel. The panel explores how AI and data science are reshaping urban real estate, and your background in intelligent city systems would bring a perspective the audience rarely gets to hear.

Quick context on IPS: It's the leading international PropTech and smart infrastructure conference in the Middle East, drawing 600+ attendees from CRE, startups, investors, and government innovation teams. April's Dubai edition is particularly strong on AI and automation in urban development, which aligns perfectly with your work.

The event organizers handle all logistics (speaker registration, panel prep materials, accommodation assistance), so your only commitment is the panel slot itself. I'll make the introduction to the main organizer and coordinate from there.

Are you available April 13-15? If you're interested, send me a quick bio and headshot and I'll get you connected to the team.

Looking forward to having you on the panel.

Best regards,
