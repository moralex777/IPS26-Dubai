Autonomous buildings at city scale: IPS Congress April panel

Matthias,

Quick context: IPS Congress runs April 13-15 in Dubai with 40,000+ institutional investors, developers, and policymakers. The main panel is "Shaping 2030: AI, Cities & the New Urban Code"  exploring how smart infrastructure, AI, climate resilience, and wellness design reshape urban development.

Why I'm writing: Siemens' work on autonomous building systems and smart cities infrastructure is exactly the center of this conversation. Decarbonization at building scale informs city-scale planning. Energy management becomes municipal strategy.

What's in it for Siemens: Direct access to institutional capital, government infrastructure teams, and developers planning smart city initiatives. 150+ media representatives. A platform to position Smart Infrastructure as foundational to how cities evolve.

The setup: We're looking for leaders who credibly bridge multiple domains. Your autonomous systems perspective is unique at this level. Not software, not advisory, but actual infrastructure engineering that scales from building to city.

What I need: 20 minutes to walk through attendee breakdown, co-speaker profiles, and media coverage. Confirmation needed by mid-January.

Does this align for you?
