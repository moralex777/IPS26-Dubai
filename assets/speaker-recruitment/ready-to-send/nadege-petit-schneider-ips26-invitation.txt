Energy innovation at institutional scale: IPS Congress April panel

Nadège,

Quick context: IPS Congress runs April 13-15 in Dubai with 40,000+ institutional investors, developers, and policymakers. The main panel is "Shaping 2030: AI, Cities & the New Urban Code"  exploring how smart infrastructure, AI, climate resilience, and wellness design reshape urban development.

Why I'm writing: Your work on energy innovation, grid transformation, and climate-tech venture leadership at Schneider is foundational to this conversation. Energy transition isn't just building-level anymore. It's the infrastructure backbone for how cities actually function and attract investment.

What's in it for Schneider: Direct access to institutional capital (sovereigns, pensions, government infrastructure teams) making energy and climate commitments. 150+ media reps covering smart city infrastructure decisions. A platform to position energy innovation as central to urban development strategy.

The setup: This isn't a climate silo panel. It's a conversation between leaders who understand how energy, smart infrastructure, AI, and wellness outcomes interconnect at the city scale.

What I need: 20 minutes to walk through attendee breakdown, co-speaker profiles, and coverage expectations. Confirmation needed by mid-January.

Does this resonate?
