AI and consumer preference: IPS Congress April panel

David,

Quick context: IPS Congress runs April 13-15 in Dubai with 40,000+ institutional investors, developers, and policymakers. The main panel is "Shaping 2030: AI, Cities & the New Urban Code"  exploring how AI, smart infrastructure, climate resilience, and wellness design reshape urban real estate.

Why I'm writing: Your work integrating generative AI into home search (Zestimate to ChatGPT) is exactly the lens institutional investors and MENA developers need. You understand what 200M+ monthly users actually want in their living spaces. That consumer-facing perspective is rare at this level.

What's in it for Zillow: Direct access to institutional capital and developers planning next-generation urban real estate. 150+ media representatives. A platform to position how AI shapes not just property transactions, but urban living preferences and city design decisions.

The setup: This isn't a typical PropTech panel. We're looking for leaders who connect the dots across domains, not specialists in one silo. Genuine conversation between equally credible operators.

What I need: 20 minutes to walk through attendee breakdown, co-speaker profiles, and coverage expectations. Confirmation needed by mid-January.

Does this fit your calendar?
