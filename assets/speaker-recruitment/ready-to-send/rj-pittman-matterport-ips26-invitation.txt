Digital twins at city scale: IPS Congress April panel

RJ,

Quick context: IPS Congress runs April 13-15 in Dubai with 40,000+ institutional investors, developers, and policymakers. The main panel is "Shaping 2030: AI, Cities & the New Urban Code"  exploring how smart infrastructure, AI, climate resilience, and wellness design reshape urban real estate.

Why I'm writing: Your digital twins work at Matterport is exactly the connective technology this conversation needs. You're capturing the data intelligence that actually informs city-scale decision-making, property valuations, climate resilience planning.

What's in it for you: Direct access to institutional capital and MENA developers making smart infrastructure decisions. 150+ media representatives covering the event. A stage to position Matterport's thought leadership as digital twins become table-stakes in city planning.

The setup: We're looking for leaders who bridge multiple domains, not specialists in one silo. Genuine conversation between equally credible operators, no vendor positioning.

What I need: 20 minutes to walk through attendee breakdown, co-panelist profiles, and media coverage expectations. Confirmation needed by mid-January.

Does this feel right for you?
