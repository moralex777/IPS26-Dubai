1Valet + IPS Congress Dubai: April panel opportunity

JP,

Quick context: IPS Congress runs April 13-15 in Dubai and draws 40,000 institutional investors, developers, and policymakers across MENA. The main panel I'm helping coordinate is "Shaping 2030: AI, Cities & the New Urban Code."

Why I'm writing: The panel is looking for leaders who can speak to how smart buildings actually impact urban development, property valuations, and investor ROI. That's exactly what 1Valet demonstrates across your installed base.

What's in it for 1Valet: Direct access to MENA institutional capital (sovereigns, pensions, major developers, government infrastructure teams). 150+ media reps covering the event. An audience actively making building technology decisions for the next 5 years.

The setup doesn't require a pitch. You'd speak your reality: how smart building systems inform city-scale planning, drive property values, enable climate objectives. The panelists are equally credible operators, so it's genuine conversation, not a vendor moment.

What I need: 20 minutes on a call to walk through attendee breakdown, media coverage expectations, and co-panelist profiles. Confirmation needed by mid-January.

We worked well together on the FPS25 panel in October. This feels like a natural extension.

Does this land for you?
