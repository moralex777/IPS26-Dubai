---

## PART 9: KEY DECISION POINTS

### Decision 1: Speaker Track Recommendation
**Recommendation:** Respond to Rijenn with both tracks preference
- IPS Conference: Vision panel (PropertyTalents + RealTimes positioning)
- Institutional Investor Summit: Boardroom briefing (Pre-A Club VC focus)

**Rationale:** Demonstrates multi-portfolio approach, maximizes audience reach, increases media coverage opportunity

---

### Decision 2: Contribution Scope
**Recommendation:** Proactively offer speaker recruitment + media partnership in initial response
- Creates partnership mentality with Rijenn
- Demonstrates willingness to add value beyond speaking
- Positions for deeper engagement

**Timeline:** Detail in discovery call, not initial email

---

### Decision 3: PTC26-IPS26 Leverage Narrative
**Recommendation:** Don't mention PTC26 explicitly in initial reply (reveals strategy)
- Wait for discovery call to gauge Rijenn's awareness
- If she mentions PTC26, amplify the PTC26→IPS26 synergy story
- If she doesn't, introduce the concept as added value

**Positioning:** "Our successful February partnership with PTC26 organizers demonstrated a systematic approach to speaker recruitment and media coverage that we can replicate and scale for IPS26"

---

## PART 10: RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Rijenn Declines Partnership Offer
**Mitigation:** Still secure speaking slot (primary objective)
**Backup Plan:** Execute as transactional speaker, use media coverage for RealTimes content

### Risk 2: PTC26 Execution Delays
**Impact:** Weakens PTC26→IPS26 leverage narrative
**Mitigation:** Begin PTC26 speaker recruitment NOW (not after Feb 4)

### Risk 3: Rijenn Expects Traditional Speaker Path
**Mitigation:** Calibrate messaging in discovery call
**Approach:** Lead with speaking interest first, partner opportunities second

### Risk 4: Timeline Compression (April event, Jan confirmation)
**Impact:** Limited preparation time
**Mitigation:** Secure speaker confirmation by January 15, begin panel prep immediately
